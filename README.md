# class-function-explanation-python
In Python, a **class function** (more commonly called a **method**) is a function that is defined inside a class and is used to define the behaviors or actions of the objects created from that class. Methods in a class operate on the instance of the class and can access or modify the object’s attributes.

### Basic Example

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.age = age

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

    def get_human_age(self):
        return self.age * 7

# Create an instance of Dog
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 4)

# Call the methods
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: "Buddy says woof!"
print(my_dog.get_human_age())  # Output: 28
```

### Key Points:
- **`__init__` Method**: This is a special method called a constructor that initializes a new object's attributes.
- **Instance Methods**: Methods like `bark()` and `get_human_age()` are instance methods, meaning they act on instances of the class and typically access the instance’s attributes.
- **`self`**: The first parameter of instance methods, `self`, refers to the instance of the class, allowing access to its attributes and other methods.

In summary, class functions (methods) define what an object can do and often operate on the data stored in the object's attributes.
